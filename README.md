This project automates the inclusion of product data into a web system using **Selenium** for browser automation, **OpenPyXL** for reading Excel files, and **CustomTkinter** for providing a simple and modern GUI interface.  
It is designed to speed up repetitive tasks by reading structured data from Excel and automatically filling out online forms without manual typing.

> 📂 The program allows the user to load an Excel file via a graphical interface, map the required fields, and automatically send the data to the target system.  
> 💡 Built for ease of use, it requires no coding skills to operate.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The application is composed of:

### 1. **Graphical Interface**
- Developed using **CustomTkinter**
- Dark mode design
- Allows the user to select the Excel file containing product data
- Displays the chosen file path in the interface

### 2. **Automation Core**
- **Selenium WebDriver** handles browser automation
- Automatically locates and interacts with HTML elements on the web system:
  - Text inputs (`<input>` and `<textarea>`)
  - Buttons (by text, CSS, or XPath selectors)
- Supports hidden (headless) browser execution for background automation

### 3. **Excel Data Reading**
- **OpenPyXL** loads the spreadsheet
- Reads each row and maps it to the form fields in the system
